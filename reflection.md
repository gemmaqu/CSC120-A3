I consulted with Joyce Liang who is on 02section, and I asked Kira Hu who takes the class last semester.
TA: Mon 7-9p.m. at 241, with Zihan Lyu. Thanks a lot to Zihan, she helps me sturcture my code and think together with me what method I should use to write each function. Also, she helped me debug the code, which makes it run successfully evntually.
More complicated than python, and a lot of concepts to understand, like attributes, constructor. And they're easy to forget if you don't code for a long time. However, the logic of writing is similar to python.
Similarities: logic. Difference: syntax
Start early!!! I know I said this on my last reflection...But I still started my work late late this week. I will definitely start early for my next homework. Also, I found using Chatgpt to learn the syntax of Java is pretty useful, because the format it present to you is easier to read than google page and it will also provide you with example.

!!!!Problem: I don't know why my vscode cann't run the code at first, and it shows a lot of red underlines, which i'm not sure if it's because of syntax error or others. I tried to download JDK package, and also follow the guidance on video to enable java test, but those all didn't work. So i have to debug on Zihan's laptop and it worked. I don't know why it becomes that.
